# Cryptocurrency-price-prediction


## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the future prices of various cryptocurrencies including Monero, Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, and Bitcoin. Utilizing historical price data, the project employs several machine learning models - Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest - to forecast future cryptocurrency values. The performance of these models is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metrics.

## Features
- Data preparation and cleaning from historical cryptocurrency prices.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models for price prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance with comprehensive metrics.
- Visualization of model performance comparisons.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Numpy for numerical operations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation metrics
- Matplotlib and Plotly for data visualization
- XGBoost for gradient boosting
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Regression
- KNN
